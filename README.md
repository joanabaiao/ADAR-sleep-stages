# ADAR - Sleep stages analysis

In this project we analised different physiological signals acquired during a whole night sleep and developed an unsupervised methodology to differentiate the different sleep stages.

### Methodology:
1. Independent Component Analysis (ICA)
2. Filtering
3. Wavelets
4. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
5. Multi-dimensional scaling (MDS)
6. Clustering
